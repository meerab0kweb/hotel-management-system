# Hotel Management System

## A Java GUI-based Application

This project was developed by a team of two students as part of an academic assignment. The goal was to **design and implement a GUI-based desktop application**, using IntelliJ and Scene Builder.

The ​Ho​tel Management System is a small application that allows hotel staff (e.g.: receptionists) and guests to interact with the system from a graphical interface (GUI) and each have access to a separate window since they have different access levels.
