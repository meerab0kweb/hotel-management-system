- General explanation:
The Hotel Management System is a small application that allows hotel staff (receptionists and managers)
and guests to interact with the system. Receptionists can add new room details, check room availability,
books rooms, check guests in and out, and view booking records. Guests can search for available rooms based
on type (single, double, suite, etc.) or price, book a room, and view their booking history.

/**
 * A model class to represent the bookings.
 * It includes the booking number, the ID of the client that is booking,
 * the number of the booked room, and the dates the beginning and end of the booking.
 * If the booking ended before starting, it means it was canceled and the client should not be billed.
 * Lombok is used to make classical methods like constructors, getters, setters, toString, etc.
