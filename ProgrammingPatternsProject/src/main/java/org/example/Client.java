- General explanation:
The Hotel Management System is a small application that allows hotel staff (receptionists and managers)
and guests to interact with the system. Receptionists can add new room details, check room availability,
books rooms, check guests in and out, and view booking records. Guests can search for available rooms based
on type (single, double, suite, etc.) or price, book a room, and view their booking history.

/**
 * This is a subclass of the User class. It inherits the user class's name and id fields, and adds
 * its own fields  for the contact information, the party size of the user and isInHotel to check
 * if the user is in the hotel currently.
 * Lombok is used to make classical methods like constructors, getters, setters, toString, etc.
