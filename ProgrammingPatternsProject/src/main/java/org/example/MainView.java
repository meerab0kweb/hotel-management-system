- General explanation:
The Hotel Management System is a small application that allows hotel staff (receptionists and managers)
and guests to interact with the system. Receptionists can add new room details, check room availability,
books rooms, check guests in and out, and view booking records. Guests can search for available rooms based
on type (single, double, suite, etc.) or price, book a room, and view their booking history.
